.SH NAME
.B shellby\fR \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shellby\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes commands read from standard input.
.PP
.B Invocation
.PP
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with arguments, the first argument is assumed to be a string containing arguments.
.B Shellby\fR tokenizes and executes commands from this string, then exits with the status of the last command executed.
.PP
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked without arguments, an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBshellby\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.
.PP
.B Command Execution
.PP
After receiving a command, \fBshellby\fR tokenizes it into words and takes the following actions:
.RS
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
.PP
If the command name is not a builtin, \fBshellby\fR searches each element of the 
\fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.PP
If either of the above searches is successful, the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.
.RE
.PP
.B Exit Status
.PP
.B Shellby\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.
.PP
.B Shellby Builtin Commands
